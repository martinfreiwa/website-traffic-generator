## CTR Click Pricing
**

The CTR traffic plan offered by Serpclix begins at
                              $197 and includes approximately 660 "clicks." Each
                              click under the starter plan costs $0.30.
                              Alternatively, the platinum plan provides 16,500
                              clicks at a price per click of $0.15.**

SearchSEO offers a simple pricing scheme that
                              starts at $29 per month for 25 clicks daily.
                              Higher-level plans accommodate up to 1,000
                              searches per day at a rate of $589 per month. The
                              cost-effectiveness of the pricing model is largely
                              attributed to the use of proxies as opposed to
                              real human interaction.

## CTR Click Location
**

Serpclix's locations and clickers are somewhat
                            restricted, as they depend on the presence of human
                            clickers in certain areas. This can lead to a
                            situation where one human clicker repeatedly clicks
                            on your SERP result multiple times.**

With its use of proxies to generate search traffic,
                            SearchSEO is capable of providing visits from any
                            country. The platform has access to millions of
                            residential IPs, enabling the delivery of traffic
                            from more than 150 countries. This capability allows
                            you to boost your rankings on local SERPs.

## Free Traffic Trial
**

Serpclix offers a 14-day trial period that comes
                            with 500 credits, roughly translating to around 55
                            clicks. In order to access this free trial, users
                            need to supply their payment information.**

SearchSEO offers a 3-day trial period during which
                            users have full access to the $30 starter plan. This
                            plan grants the same amount of traffic as the
                            regular starter plan, amounting to 90 clicks within
                            that time frame.

## Support
**

SerpClix falls short in terms of customer service,
                            offering no live support. Furthermore, the process
                            of setting up an account with them necessitates the
                            submission of payment information which is then used
                            to charge you automatically for a subscription after
                            the trial ends.**

SearchSEO offers a live chat support function.
                            However, their response speed could use some
                            improvement. Based on our experience, instant
                            replies were not given when contacting them through
                            chat, with responses often taking approximately a
                            day to arrive.
