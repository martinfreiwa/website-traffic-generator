## Introduction: A Comprehensive Traffic Masters Review

Founded in 2008, Traffic-Masters has evolved from a simple pop-under advertising agency to a versatile self-serve traffic platform. This Traffic Masters Review aims to cover the platform's variety of traffic plans, advanced targeting features, social media promotion, mobile advertising, and a self-serve push visitor platform designed for agencies.

## Dashboard: Control Your Campaigns

The Traffic Masters dashboard is touted as being incredibly user-friendly, but there's a catch—it's only accessible to users who have made a purchase. Unfortunately, the platform doesn't offer a way to preview the dashboard before committing financially. According to Traffic Masters, their dashboard provides "complete control" over your traffic campaigns. However, it's important to clarify what "complete control" entails in this context.
### Limited Settings

In the case of Traffic Masters, having "complete control" means you can start, stop, and pause your campaigns at will. Contrary to some expectations, the dashboard doesn't offer features like real-time analytics, daily visitor count adjustments, or the ability to change targeting locations on the fly.**Do not aspect more features then you can see in the screenshot on the left!

## What is CPM?

CPM stands for "Cost Per Mille," which is a common advertising metric used to measure the cost of displaying an ad to 1,000 people (or "impressions").CPM is commonly used in online advertising, particularly for display and banner ads, but can also be used for other types of ads, such as video and mobile ads. It is a useful metric for advertisers to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of their advertising campaigns and compare different advertising options.
## Support

While Traffic-Masters' support may not be as responsive or helpful as some users may expect, the platform offers a comprehensive knowledge base and a help widget found on the right-hand side of every page, which provides answers to frequently asked questions. The platform also offers email support.
### Refund Policy

Traffic Masters offers full refunds for campaigns that have not yet been activated! We advise to test their traffic first and then buying larger amounts of website traffic.****
#### Warning!
Once a campaign or plan is live, Traffic Masters is unable to process refunds requests, without exceptions!

## Critical Traffic Quality

Traffic Masters prides itself on delivering authentic, high-quality traffic to your website. Unlike other platforms that might rely on bots or low-quality sources, Traffic Masters ensures that every visitor is a real person actively browsing the internet. Their advanced AI targeting system scans your website to select the most relevant demographic, optimizing your campaign for better results.
### The Reality - Provided Traffic Quality

In our Traffic Masters Review, they did not offer extensive targeting, allowing you to fine-tune your campaigns based on specific demographics and geo-locations. The provided targeting options are limited and rudimental. However, the most basic targeting options did exist.
## Reviews from Trustpilot

It's worth mentioning that Traffic Masters has received mixed reviews on Trustpilot. The platform currently holds a rating of 2.6, with some users praising the service while others have raised concerns about the quality of traffic and customer support. Some reviews indicate issues with dashboard analytics not aligning with other tracking tools like Google Analytics.

![Traffic Master Trustpilot review 4](assets/img/blog/trafficmasters-review-4.webp)

Therefore, while Traffic Masters offers a range of features and targeting options, potential users should exercise caution and perhaps start with a smaller campaign to evaluate the service's effectiveness for their specific needs.
## Traffic Masters Reseller Program: A Closer Look

Traffic Masters offers a white-label reseller program that allows users to sell visitor traffic directly to their clients. As a reseller, you gain access to Traffic Masters' extensive inventory at wholesale prices, ensuring that your clients only see your branding when placing orders.
#### How It Works

- 1
#### Order Your Account

A one-time fee is required to set up your reseller account.
- 2
#### Create Traffic Packages

Customize your own traffic packages with varying volumes and prices.
- 3
#### Sell Visitors

You can sell these packages to your clients through your own website or third-party platforms.
### Limitations

While the program offers a range of features, it lacks comprehensive documentation, which could be a hurdle for newcomers. Additionally, the reseller discount appears to be minimal, raising questions about the program's profitability.
- Full White Label Reseller Panel
- Create Traffic Packages
- Account Creation For Clients
- Full Control Over Pricing
- Easily Edit Client Details
- Confirm New Orders
## Conclusion

In this Traffic Masters Review, we note that the platform offers varied traffic plans and a 10% subscription discount. However, its dashboard lacks advanced features and is only accessible after purchase. Trustpilot reviews are mixed, pointing to inconsistencies in traffic quality and customer support. The white-label reseller program has merits but also significant limitations, including a low reseller discount.

While the platform's support may not be as responsive or helpful as some users may expect, we do not recommend to buy website traffic from Traffic Masters as there are better options available.[30+ Website Traffic Provider Review - Read More](https://traffic-bot.com/blog/30-best-traffic-bots)Traffic Types:[Website Traffic](#)[Bot Traffic](#)[Targeted Traffic](#)User Dashboard:
