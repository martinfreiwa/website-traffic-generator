It generates this SEO Traffic using residential proxies, employing them to initiate Google searches, which in turn, elevates the CTR, boosting your SEO efficacy. SearchSEO.io stands as a valuable asset for amplifying your Google rankings,**with a focus on CTR Manipulation.****
### Traffic Settings

![SparkTraffic Logo](assets/img/blog/comparison/sparktraffic-logo-2.webp)

Although SparkTraffic might offer fewer traffic features compared to SearchSEO.io, it still provides the fundamental features necessary for elevating your SEO ranking. Unlike SearchSEO,**all features are fully accessible**regardless of the plan you opt for, making it an excellent choice for smaller plans.**

![Free Traffic Bot landing page.](assets/img/blog/comparison/searchseo-logo-2.webp)

SearchSEO.io provides over**10 unique features**to tailor your automated traffic bot project to meet your specific requirements. The extent of these features is limited by your chosen plan. For instance, the basic plan offers a session duration of 1 minute, while the premium plan extends the duration to 5 minutes per session.**
### CTR Click/Traffic Pricing

![SparkTraffic Logo](assets/img/blog/comparison/sparktraffic-logo-2.webp)

SparkTraffic operates with a straightforward pricing model that begins at**$49 per month for 100 clicks.**More extensive plans offer up to 10,000 searches per month at a cost of $1497 per month. Its pricing is notably higher than that of SearchSEO, as SparkTraffic asserts the use of real human traffic instead of proxies.**

![SearchSEO Logo](assets/img/blog/comparison/searchseo-logo-2.webp)

SearchSEO presents a straightforward pricing structure that begins at**$29 per month for 25 clicks per day.**More advanced plans provide up to 1,000 searches per day at a cost of $589 per month. The pricing model is cost-effective primarily due to the use of proxies rather than actual human engagement.**
### CTR Click/Visit Location

![SparkTraffic Logo](assets/img/blog/comparison/sparktraffic-logo-2.webp)

Since SparkTraffic relies on human traffic to generate Google searches, the number of clicks per location can be limited. While SparkTraffic promises higher quality due to the use of human clickers, it's possible that a small group of users might generate the bulk of your clicks. This can increase your CTR, but it may not be the best practice. It's also worth noting that**not all locations might be available.****

![SearchSEO Logo](assets/img/blog/comparison/searchseo-logo-2.webp)

Thanks to their utilization of proxies for generating search traffic, SearchSEO can deliver visits from almost any country. The platform boasts millions of residential IPs, allowing delivery of**traffic from over 150 countries.**This feature enables you to enhance your rankings on particular search engines. For example, choosing Spanish clicks will ensure all searches are conducted from Spanish IPs.**
### Free Traffic Trial

![SparkTraffic Logo](assets/img/blog/comparison/sparktraffic-logo-2.webp)

SparkTraffic provides**50 free credits to trial their CTR Manipulation service**. These credits should suffice to test their service over a longer period compared to SearchSEO, though they might not last for an extended time. However, it may not be adequate to assess long-term effects. For a more lasting impact, purchasing a paid plan is advisable**

![SearchSEO Logo](assets/img/blog/comparison/searchseo-logo-2.webp)

SearchSEO provides a**3-day trial plan,**which during our testing delivered 24 searches per day. This trial offers an opportunity to verify the delivery of traffic, though it may not be sufficient to observe long-term impacts. For lasting effects, a paid plan would be necessary.**
### Support

![SparkTraffic Logo](assets/img/blog/comparison/sparktraffic-logo-2.webp)

SparkTraffic also has a live chat feature, with a notably responsive support team that**swiftly addresses your queries.**There are times when certain support staff may not be equipped to assist you, resulting in your ticket being escalated to a more knowledgeable team member. Typically, these escalated issues are rectified by the following day.**

![SearchSEO Logo](assets/img/blog/comparison/searchseo-logo-2.webp)
