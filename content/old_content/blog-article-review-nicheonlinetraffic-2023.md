## Dashboard

In this Niche Online Traffic Review, it's worth noting that NicheOnlineTraffic doesn't have a traditional user dashboard. Instead, the website is designed like an online shop, with limited options for customizing the traffic you receive. This lack of customization might be a drawback for some users who prefer a more tailored approach to their online advertising campaigns.

## Pricing

NicheOnlineTraffic offers several pricing plans depending on the duration of the traffic delivery. The Bronze plan costs $59.00 per month, while the Silver plan is available for $119.00 every three months. These plans provide daily visitors and include features like real IP address, AdSense safe, keyword targeting, and niche targeting options. More expensive plans are available, such as the Gold and Platinum plans, which offer longer durations and additional features.

## Support

While the website does feature a live chat option, the support team does not reply, which can be frustrating for users who require immediate assistance. Additionally, the contact us page is a simple form to fill out, which might not be the most helpful method for users who need more detailed support.

## Traffic Quality

The traffic quality provided by NicheOnlineTraffic is not bad in terms of analytics, as real targeted users will visit the website. However, there is no guarantee that these visitors will convert into paying customers. There might need to be more than the amount of traffic offered to outperform competitors and rank higher on search engines.
