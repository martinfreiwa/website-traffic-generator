## What Is CTR Manipulation

CTR (Click-Through Rate) manipulation refers to the
                        process of artificially influencing the click-through
                        rate of a specific webpage or search result. The
                        click-through rate is the ratio of clicks a link
                        receives to the total number of users who view the link.
                        In the context of search engine optimization (SEO), CTR
                        manipulation aims to boost the ranking of a webpage on
                        search engine results pages (SERPs) by generating an
                        unusually high number of clicks on the link compared to
                        its impressions.

CTR manipulation can be achieved through various
                        methods, including:
- Using automated bots or scripts to click on a specific
                          link repeatedly, making it appear more popular to
                          search engines.
- Engaging in click farms, where a group of individuals
                          is paid to click on a particular link multiple times
                          to inflate its click-through rate.
- Encouraging users on social media or other online
                          platforms to click on a specific link, thus inflating
                          its click-through rate.

                        smooth navigation and quick access to all necessary
