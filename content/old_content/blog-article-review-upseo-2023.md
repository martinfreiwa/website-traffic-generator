## Red Flags and Concerns

### Mixed Reviews

While the service comes highly recommended on their own platform, external reviews tell a different story. Trustpilot and Webmaster Reviews have several users claiming that the service is a scam, with some even stating that they received no traffic at all.
### Questionable Traffic Quality

Some users have reported receiving traffic from sketchy URLs, with high bounce rates and zero time spent on the website. This could potentially harm your SEO efforts rather than help them.
### Customer Support Issues

Despite the 24/7 customer support claim, some users have reported poor customer service experiences, including unresponsive support and account suspensions without clear reasons.
