SigmaTraffic's pricing plans cater to different user
                        needs, providing options for various budgets. The NANO

                        2,000 unique visitors, and up to 30 seconds on every

## 3. Support

While SigmaTraffic offers a live chat feature, it is
                        only sometimes available. Users can send messages
                        through the live chat, but getting an immediate response
                        may be difficult. This could be an area where
                        SigmaTraffic can improve to provide better customer
                        support.

                        traffic. Users can choose from traffic types, such as
                        direct, organic, social, or referral. They can also set
                        the return visitor rate and bounce rate, allowing for
                        greater control over their campaigns. Based on user

                        this traffic may not generate clicks or make purchases.
