## What Is Bulk Traffic?

Bulk traffic is akin to snagging website traffic in hefty quantities to land the sweetest deal on pricing. It's essentially the wholesale version of buying website traffic, where the more you grab, the less you shell out per unit. So, if scoring a bargain while fueling your site with a traffic surge sounds appealing, going bulk is your ticket!
## Why Buy Bulk Traffic?

### Perks of Bulk Traffic Shopping

One glaring perk of opting for bulk website traffic is the neat savings on hefty orders - you could trim your costs by up to 60% compared to standard pricing. Bulk traffic buying primarily caters to two scenarios. Firstly, it's a savvy route for those looking to purchase low-cost traffic and resell it on platforms like Fiverr. Secondly, it's a one-shot deal for those wanting a traffic bonanza on their site without the monthly buying hassle, securing a sweet price point.
## Top 3 Reasons To Buy Bulk Traffic

**Ad Revenue**Ad-displaying websites can reel in more advertisers as traffic metrics soar, though artificial traffic won’t interact with ads, a caveat for AdSense users.

**Metric Manipulation**Beefed-up traffic digits can glam up a site’s appeal, luring advertisers, investors, or users, showcased on platforms like SimilarWeb, used by marketers for potential partnerships evaluations.

**Marketing & SEO Agencies**To meet client expectations or fast-track results, dabbling in cheap website traffic can be a boon, buying time, and hastening SEO initial outcomes.
## Drawbacks of Artificial Bulk Traffic

**Quality Quagmire**Often brewed with shoddy software and dodgy proxies, the quality of bulk traffic is a gamble, especially when sourced from freelancers on platforms like Fiverr.

**Penalty Peril**Google’s eagle-eyed algorithms can spot unnatural traffic antics. With over half of global web traffic being bot-driven, high-grade traffic using residential proxies is key to dodge penalties. A misstep here and your site might tumble down the search rankings.In a nutshell, while authentic bulk traffic is a hallmark of a flourishing website, the artificial counterpart often gets the cold shoulder due to potential pitfalls and ethical quandaries.
