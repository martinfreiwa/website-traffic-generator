## User Dashboard

SparkTraffic has recently reverted to a design to more modern and interactive design. In 2019, they had the best Dashboard. In our SparkTraffic review, we found that although the dashboard interface looked outdated, it was the most functional when managing more than just a few traffic projects. Sparktraffic now has a modern Dashboard, but it still requires much work to ensure compatibility with every browser.

### Favorite Feature Update

The most remarkable improvement is the ability to check the amount of bot traffic delivered in the project overview. Previously it was necessary to go into each project to see the amount of traffic being delivered.This new "small" adjustment allows you to check your traffic statistics with less effort. And if there is an issue with your traffic project, it can be identified much faster than before.

## SparkTraffic Pricing

SparkTraffic offers a wide range of SEO services, including Bot Traffic (Economy & Professional Bot Traffic), SEO Traffic (SERP Traffic), Backlinks, and Guest Posting. In this review we will focus on their bot traffic & SEO Traffic (SERP Traffic).In general, sparktraffic offers competitive pricing models. Each traffic plan starts at a low cost to test its service, while larger plans are available and cost far less. In addition, Sparktraffic offers excellent discounts if you purchase their bot traffic in a large amount.

### Economy Bot Traffic

The Economy Bot Traffic plans presented by SparkTraffic generate their website traffic with datacenter ips. Datacenter Ips are the lowest quality of ips and can be recognized as spam traffic, and most traffic trackers will filter such website traffic from their statistics. The pricing for their economy traffic plans is very cheap, but it's use is very limited!
## Not Compatible With Google Analytics 4

Additionally, it's essential to be aware that this traffic will not be compatible with Google Analytics 4.It's worth noting that this type of website traffic is primarily used to manipulate traffic statistics and should be recognized as such.

### Professional Bot Traffic

The professional traffic bot plan uses unique residential IPs. Residential Ips are far more expensive. Using residential Ips to generate website traffic is the best option if you are looking for large amounts of website traffic with high quality. Using those ips makes it possible to simulate human website traffic, improving your statistics and search engine rankings.Compared to the economy traffic plan, all professional traffic plans have more features, such as shorteners, UTM campaigns, and more.Most importantly, this website traffic will get tracked by far more traffic trackers, such as Google Analytics 4!
## Compatible With Google Analytics 4

Generating website traffic with residential IPs, which the professional traffic plan uses, is an excellent way to improve your rankings on search engines and statistics.

## Sparktraffic Support

SparkTraffic stands out among other traffic bot services with its exceptional live chat support. The team is highly responsive and provides top-notch assistance. However, it's worth noting that during the nighttime in Europe, their chat support is outsourced to a third-party company with limited expertise beyond the standard FAQ. While they can effectively address basic inquiries, more intricate or challenging questions may require creating a support ticket.SparkTraffic also offers a modest knowledge base to aid users with fundamental queries.

## knowledge Base

SparkTraffic also provides a limited knowledge base to assist users with basic inquiries. However, their knowledge base consists of only 16 articles, which may seem small compared to Traffic-bot.com's offerings.
## Traffic Quality

SparkTraffic delivers excellent traffic quality consistently without bugs or problems across all tested traffic types. The ability to select from different quality options is an incredible advantage as it allows you to obtain the specific type of traffic you require.
