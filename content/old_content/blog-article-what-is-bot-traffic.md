### How to protect your website from bot traffic

There are several ways to protect from bad bot traffic:
- **Implementing CAPTCHA:**CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public
              Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) can effectively
              prevent bad bots from accessing your website.
- **Using a Web Application Firewall (WAF):**A WAF can help to
              block malicious traffic from reaching your website, including bad
              bots.
- **Blocking IP addresses:**Blocking specific IP addresses that
              are known to be associated with bad bot traffic can help prevent
              them from accessing your website.
- **Implementing user-agent blocking:**User-agents are the
              identification strings that browsers and other software use to
              identify themselves to servers. By blocking certain user-agents,
              you can prevent bad bots from accessing your website.
- **Monitoring logs and analytics:**Regularly monitoring your
              website's logs and analytics can help you identify patterns of bot
              traffic and quickly detect and respond to any malicious activity.
- **Implementing rate limiting:**Rate limiting is a method of
              controlling the number of requests a user or bot can make to your
              website over a given period of time. By setting a rate limit, you
              can prevent bad bots from overwhelming your website with too many
              requests.
- **Using an anti-bot service:**An anti-bot service uses various
              techniques to detect and block bad bot traffic, including IP
              address blocking, user-agent blocking, and rate limiting.

It's important to note that protecting from bad bot traffic is an
            ongoing process and requires regular monitoring and updates to stay
            effective.
